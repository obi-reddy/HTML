Certainly! Here's an example of a basic HTML code structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  <p>This is a basic HTML page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Let's break down the code:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This declaration specifies the HTML version you are using. In this case, it's HTML5, which is the latest version of HTML.

- `<html>`: The opening tag of the HTML document. It represents the root element of the HTML page.

- `<head>`: The head section of the HTML document. It contains meta-information about the page, such as the title, CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, and more.

- `<title>`: The title of the web page, which is displayed in the browser's title bar or tab.

- `<body>`: The body section of the HTML document. It contains the visible content of the web page, such as text, images, links, and other HTML elements.

- `<h1>`: A heading element. It represents the main heading of the page and is typically displayed with larger font size and more prominent styling.

- `<p>`: A paragraph element. It represents a block of text or content.

In the example above, the web page will display a heading saying "Hello, World!" and a paragraph below it saying "This is a basic HTML page."

You can modify this code and add more HTML elements as needed to create your own web pages.
